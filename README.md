Fork this repo to your personal GitHub account. Build a hybrid payment product on Avalanche. Deploy to Fuji testnet. Present at Builders Connect.

---

## What you will build

A payment product that bridges M-Pesa and USDC on Avalanche C-Chain. By Week 4 you will have a deployed smart contract, a working M-Pesa STK Push integration, a frontend connected to Core Wallet, and a live product URL.

The integration sequence is intentional: Core Wallet first, then Solidity and ERC-20 tokens, then on-chain data feeds and oracles, then M-Pesa as the final integration. Each week builds on the last.

## Getting started

### 1. Fork this repository

Click **Use this template** or **Fork** at the top right of this page. Fork to your personal GitHub account, not to an organisation.

### 2. Clone your fork

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-HANDLE/minihack-cohort1-template.git
cd minihack-cohort1-template
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values. Never commit this file — it is already in `.gitignore`. If you accidentally commit a private key, rotate it immediately.

### 5. Verify your setup

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

No errors means your environment is working. If you see missing module errors, run `npm install` first.

### 6. Get Fuji testnet AVAX

Visit [core.app/tools/testnet-faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet) and request AVAX to your Core Wallet Fuji address. You need AVAX to deploy contracts and send transactions on Fuji.

## Tools to install

```bash
# Node.js 20 LTS — nodejs.org
node --version   # must show v20.x.x

# Git — git-scm.com

# Hardhat (installed via npm install from this template)
npx hardhat --version

# Postman — postman.com (for testing Daraja API in Week 3)
```

Also install: VS Code, Core Wallet browser extension, Ngrok (for Week 3 webhook tunnelling)

---

## Weekly workflow

At the start of each week, create a new branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b week-{N}-{your-github-handle}
```

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b week-3-scotch
```

Build your deliverable on that branch. Commit often with clear messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "add ERC-20 transfer function with balance check"
git commit -m "fix STK Push callback handler for duplicate transactions"

# Bad
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "wip"
```

When done, open a pull request against the `main` branch of your own fork.

**PR title format:**
```
[Cohort 1 Week N] Your Name - Deliverable title
```

**Example:**
```
[Cohort 1 Week 3] Joseph Njoroge - STK Push integration with Core Wallet frontend
```

Fill in every section of the PR template. Submit the PR link in `#submissions` on Discord before Sunday midnight EAT.
